I am Jack's repository for miscellaneous small scripts and digital doodling. For projects so small they don't get their own repository. Basic hacks, workarounds, examples of my prowess in bash-fu,(and python).

Licensing will varry, check each script's comments for terms and conditions. Most popular licenses are GPLv3(my favorite), and FreeBSD(preffered by current place of employment). While I personally preffer GPL, I find both acceptable.
